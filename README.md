# DeepLearning_CrowdCounting

Hey all,

Thank you for looking at my Deep Learning Project.

This project was done with the objective of crowd counting (best estimation). I have created a 2 part deep learning model that generates a density map which then uses it to predict the number of people within the crowd.

I have uploaded the various jupyter notebook files that I have created throughout the course of my project during my CS elective module.

I have also uploaded the final presentation slides as well as the project report. These 2 documents will explain the issues that I have encountered within my projects as well as 
the process of my project.

Unfortunately, due to the file size limitation of GitHub, I am unable to upload the weights of the 2 parts deep learning model.

If you have any comments, feel free to let me know as this is my first project and I would like to know how I can better improve it.

Thank you very much!
Jun Ming
